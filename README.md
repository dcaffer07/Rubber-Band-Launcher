### Overview
##### What are you trying to accomplish?
>We (Jabari and Dominick), plan to design a device that shoots a rbber band. This will be accomplished by a rubber band being pulled tightly around variouse different 3D printed objects along with a servo at the end that will cause the rubber band to fly when the servo turns.  The tention of the rubber band will allow for this to occur and function. We will use variouse differnt platforms such as OnShape, Tinkercad, and Aurduino, to help us plan ot the variouse steps pof the process ad reach our end goal.   
##### What’s it going to do?
>As stated, the goal of the project id to use the variouse platforms we have learned to use to LAUNCH A RUBBER BAND!
##### What’s it going to look like?
>The base will be a peice of acrilic that is almost like a table with 4 3D printed legs hlding it up.  The aurduino, breadboard, and batteries will be attacthed to the side of the base facing the floor, and the buttons, servo, and other parts to stretch the rubber band will be located on the top part of the table. 
##### Who is incharge of what?
>Dominick: He will be in charge of helping create an initial design, and than will be in charge of designing and creating it on OnShape.  Additionally, Dominick will be there during the lazer cutting and 3D printing process, and will put together the design and all of its parts.  
>Jabari: He will also be helping research design ideas to get the procces going.  Additionally, Jabari will be in charge of creating the code, and wiring for the design.  He will impliment his wiring design in the lab and int the final project.

### Criteria and Constraints
##### The servo had to be (Criteria)
> - Able to fit in a hand
> - Battery-powered
> - One Button turns the servo one way
> - The other button turns the servo the other way
##### Constraints
> - The servo could only be made of materials found in the CHS sigma lab
> - This was out first time doing many of these things such as lazer cutting, preparing for 3D printing, and being in the lab!
> - Partners could not colaborate as easily as we were in different spaces and areas throughout.

### Cad Design on OnShape 
> When creating this design, it was important that the structure was functional and easy to use without it being over complicated.  Additionally, it was important that the structure fit the criteria of being able to fit in one hand, which sounds simple, however this become a very large and difficult factor when the rubber band needs to be stretched to a point of being able to shoot with some umph.  This is when we cam up with the idea of wraping the rubber band, in lther words, we constructed this design in simolaritie to how one owould shoot a ruber band with their hand (hook the band arond your middel finger, wrap it around your thumb which is pointed up, and than hook it to your pointer finger pointing to where you want the band to shoot, and then release it by straigtening your middle finger).  This is the design that we decided to go with, only instead of a pointer finger there was a 3D printed triangle, and instead of a thum there was another 3D printed trinagle, and finally, instead of a middle finger, there is a servo which releases the rubber band by turning its head.  
##### Steps
> 1) Create a base with all of the nessesary space and holes for additional attatchments including legs.
> 2) Create the triangels which stretch the rubber band and allow for it to fly and attcth thos strategically to the base. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71406831/120542777-80129680-c3b9-11eb-9420-c0bc74d22609.png))
> 3) Add all buttons, servos, ardunios, and battery mounts to the base which already contain muach of the holes for these things.
