### Overview
##### What are you trying to accomplish?
>We (Jabari and Dominick), plan to design a device that shoots a rbber band. This will be accomplished by a rubber band being pulled tightly around variouse different 3D printed objects along with a servo at the end that will cause the rubber band to fly when the servo turns.  The tention of the rubber band will allow for this to occur and function. We will use variouse differnt platforms such as OnShape, Tinkercad, and Aurduino, to help us plan ot the variouse steps pof the process ad reach our end goal.   

Criteria (goals):
What’s it going to do?
Launch a rubber band

What’s it going to look like?
There will be almost a table that is small enough to be hand held, and the battery and wiring will be hooked to the side facing the ground and than on the top there will be the buttons, servo, and other material that is used to tighten the rubber band into the launch position.
Any optional goals, should things go well?  (added lights, buzzers, etc)
We could possibly make the platform shooter move using a servo.

Whose researching what?
Dominick: will research other servo rubber band launchers for ideas.  
Jabari: will research design ideas.
